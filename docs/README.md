## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

*Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two.  What were the advantages of working in this way?  How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?*

Writing clean, reusable code is key to achieving a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program.  For example, the CRUD Python module created in Project One was able to be reused in multiple programs throughout this course to access the animal shelter database.  In terms of future use, with a few easy modification, the module could be made more generic so that you can connect to any MongoDB database collection and then perform create, read, update, or delete operations on that collection.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

*Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested.  How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?  What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?*

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I find it best to break the problem down into smaller parts.  From there I determine the best place to begin and start solving that small part of the problem.  As more parts are completed I'm able to take on more and more complicated parts of the problem until the entire thing is solved.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

*How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?*

The work that computer scientists do is important.  For instance, with this project for Grazioso Salvare, without computer scientists to create this dashboard, all of the data they were trying to sort through would have to be manually searched.  That is a tedious and time consuming task that would make their goals unachievable.
